# Competitive Positioning | v1.0.0 | 2026-02-03

ATR (Resto) competes in the AI-assisted business building space but with a fundamentally wider scope than alternatives.

**ATR vs Competitors:**
- OpenClaw: Local-only, personal/dev-focused. ATR is cloud-native, business-scoped.
- Replit Agent: Code generation focus. ATR manages the full business, not just code.
- v0/Lovable: UI generation tools. ATR is a business operator, not a design tool.
- Cursor: Developer IDE with AI. ATR targets non-technical users building businesses.

**ATR's Moat:**
1. Manages more resources than any competitor (real accounts, real actions)
2. Wider range of capabilities (strategy, GTM, finance, ops — not just code)
3. Better grasp for complex tasks (full business context, not just code context)
4. Ecosystem pipeline (hackathons, fellowship, accelerator) feeds the product
5. Premium training creates power users and community
6. Knowledge base system maintains persistent business intelligence

**Positioning Statement:** ATR is not a code tool — it's a cloud-based AI co-founder that builds and operates your entire digital business. Competitors generate code. Resto runs companies.

**Key Differentiator:** End-to-end business scope. From market research to deployment to investor pitch to first revenue — one agent, one relationship.
