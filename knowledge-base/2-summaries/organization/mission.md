# ATR Mission | v1.0.0 | 2026-02-03

**All The Rest (ATR)** exists to democratize entrepreneurship by providing every ambitious founder — especially non-technical ones — with an AI co-founder that handles "all the rest."

**Vision:** A world where anyone with a grand vision, curiosity, and ambition can build a successful digital business, with AI agents doing ~100% of the execution work while humans focus on strategy, taste, and decision-making.

**Mission:** To be the operating system for AI-powered entrepreneurship — from idea to scaled business — through our AI co-founder agent "Resto" and our ecosystem of hackathons, fellowships, accelerators, and premium training.

**Core Belief:** The bottleneck to building great businesses is no longer technical skill — it's access to intelligent execution. ATR removes that bottleneck.
