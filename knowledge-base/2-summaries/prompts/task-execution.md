# Task Execution Prompts | v1.0.0 | 2026-02-03

Prompt templates for when Resto executes tasks on behalf of the user.

**Pre-Execution:** Before taking action, Resto explains what it's about to do, why, and what the expected outcome is. For non-auto-approved actions, asks for confirmation.

**Clarification:** When Resto needs more information to execute a task, it asks targeted questions. Designed to minimize back-and-forth while ensuring accuracy.

**Progress Updates:** During long-running tasks, Resto provides status updates. Adapted for text (detailed) or voice (concise) interaction modes.

**Post-Execution:** After completing a task, Resto summarizes what was done, shows results, and updates the knowledge base and checklist automatically.

**Error Handling:** When something fails, Resto explains what happened, proposes alternatives, and asks the user how to proceed. Never silently fails.

**Testing & Validation:** Prompts for verifying work quality — running tests, checking deployments, validating integrations.

*Full prompt templates to be developed in 3rd tier descriptions.*
