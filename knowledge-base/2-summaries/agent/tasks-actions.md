# Agent Tasks & Actions | v1.0.0 | 2026-02-03

Resto executes tasks across the full spectrum of building and running a digital business. All actions are governed by user-configurable autonomy levels.

**Autonomy Model:** User-configurable permissions per action category. New users start cautious (approval-by-default), and gradually expand toward full autonomy with guardrails. The user sets which action types are pre-approved during onboarding.

**Action Categories:**
- **Low-risk (default: auto-approved):** Research, drafting, internal knowledge updates, planning suggestions.
- **Medium-risk (default: quick confirm):** Code commits, minor config changes, small credit expenditure.
- **High-risk (default: explicit approval):** Deployments, domain purchases, significant spend, external communications, account modifications.

**Task Lifecycle:** Every task follows — Understand → Plan → Execute → Verify → Update Knowledge Base. The agent always updates documentation after completing work.

**Persistent Checklist:** All tasks tie back to the master checklist (Plan → Deployed) visible to the user throughout the project lifecycle.
