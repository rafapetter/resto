# Onboarding Flow | v1.0.0 | 2026-02-03

Three-phase progressive disclosure onboarding designed for non-technical users.

**Phase 1 — Template Gallery (Orient):**
User browses templates/examples (SaaS dashboard, e-commerce store, marketplace, etc.). This grounds their understanding of what's possible. They select a starting point — not committing, just orienting.

**Phase 2 — Guided Wizard (Structure):**
Step-by-step questions capture fundamentals: application type (web/mobile), industry, problem to solve, suggested solution. This efficiently collects known-structure data. Also prompts user to connect their accounts (GitHub, Vercel, email, payment provider, code gen tools, etc.).

**Phase 3 — Conversational Deep-Dive (Personalize):**
Resto takes over. Asks nuanced follow-up questions, validates assumptions, proposes a plan. Similar to how a human co-founder would dig into the details. Covers: market research, GTM strategy, risk analysis, tech decisions, timeline.

**First Output:** A comprehensive plan with a persistent, visible checklist showing every step from Plan to Deployed. This checklist remains visible throughout the entire journey and ties to agent task execution.

**Account Setup:** During planning phase, Resto identifies required services and guides user through connecting each one via OAuth or API key.
