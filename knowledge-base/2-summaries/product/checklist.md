# Business Building Checklist | v1.0.0 | 2026-02-03

The persistent checklist is the backbone of the user experience. It's always visible, shows progress from Plan to Deployed, and ties directly to agent task execution.

**Master Checklist Structure:**
- Discovery & Planning: Business model defined, core features identified, tech stack confirmed, accounts connected
- Market Validation: Research completed, ICP defined, assumptions validated
- Foundation: Project structure created, auth configured, database schema designed
- Core Build: Primary features implemented, UI/UX completed, integrations connected
- Quality & Testing: Testing passed, security review done
- GTM Preparation: Landing page, marketing channels, pitch materials
- Launch: Domain configured, deployed to production, monitoring active
- Post-Launch: Analytics tracking, user feedback loop, iteration plan

**Dual Purpose:** User-facing (dashboard view for oversight) and agent-facing (guides what agents work on next). Both views show the same data.

**Dynamic:** Checklist adapts based on the type of business being built. SaaS, e-commerce, and marketplace each have tailored sub-items.
