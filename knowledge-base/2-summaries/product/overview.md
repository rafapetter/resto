# Product Overview | v1.0.0 | 2026-02-03

ATR's core product is **Resto** — a cloud-based AI co-founder agent that helps non-technical entrepreneurs build and run digital businesses.

**What it is:** An always-on, cloud-native AI agent that can access and operate any internet resource on behalf of the entrepreneur. It manages the entire business lifecycle — from idea validation to a running, revenue-generating business.

**What it is NOT:** A code generator, a UI builder, or a traditional SaaS platform. It is a business operator that happens to also write code.

**Core capabilities:**
- Chat and voice-first interaction
- Full business lifecycle management (strategy, product, tech, GTM, ops)
- Real account management (GitHub, Vercel, Stripe, email, domains, etc.)
- Self-maintaining 3-tier knowledge base per business
- Code generation through user-connected tools or LLM APIs
- Persistent checklist from Plan to Deployed

**Target users:** Non-technical entrepreneurs with grand vision, curiosity, and ambition. Also business executives looking to leverage AI in their operations.

**Comparable to:** OpenClaw, but cloud-native and business-scoped (not just personal/dev).
